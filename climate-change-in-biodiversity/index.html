            <p>
			Climate change poses a significant threat to biodiversity, with rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events threatening the survival of species and ecosystems worldwide. From coral bleaching and habitat loss to species migration and altered phenology, climate change impacts are evident across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments. By addressing the root causes of climate change and implementing strategies to mitigate its impacts, we can protect biodiversity and ensure the long-term health and resilience of ecosystems for future generations.
			<br> <br>
			Moreover, preserving biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem services such as pollination, nutrient cycling, and climate regulation, which are critical for human well-being and survival. Healthy ecosystems provide essential resources such as clean air, fresh water, and fertile soil, as well as cultural and recreational opportunities that enrich our lives. By conserving biodiversity and restoring degraded habitats, we can enhance ecosystem resilience, support sustainable development, and build a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
