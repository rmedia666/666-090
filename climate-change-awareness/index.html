                    By 2010, the global awareness of climate change had reached unprecedented levels, with scientific evidence highlighting the urgent need for action. Reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other research bodies emphasized the impact of human activities on global warming and the potential consequences for the planet. This period saw a surge in environmental activism, with widespread calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adopting sustainable practices.

                        Governments and organizations began to implement policies aimed at mitigating climate change, such as carbon trading schemes and renewable energy incentives. Public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives sought to inform people about the importance of sustainability and the need for collective efforts to protect the environment.
