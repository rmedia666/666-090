                    Practitioners of aesthetic medicine often work closely with patients to understand their goals and develop personalized treatment plans. They must have a deep understanding of anatomy, physiology, and dermatology to ensure safe and effective outcomes. Aesthetic medicine combines science and artistry, helping patients look and feel their best.
