                    Aerospace engineering is the field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft. It involves the design, testing, and production of aerospace vehicles and systems, combining principles of physics, mathematics, and materials science.
                    <br>
                    Aerospace engineers work on a wide range of projects, from designing commercial airplanes and military jets to developing spacecraft for exploration and communication satellites for global connectivity. They must consider factors such as aerodynamics, propulsion, and materials science to create vehicles that are safe, efficient, and cost-effective.
